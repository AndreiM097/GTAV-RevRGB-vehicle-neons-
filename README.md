# GTAV-RevRGB-vehicle-neons-
This is a mod for GTA V that has a few different options but the main one being the vehicle's neon changing it's color according to the revelations of the engine which is why I chose the name RevRGB. I have also created another C++ app that will do the same but with an arduino uno board and a actual rgb led.(check my repository)
